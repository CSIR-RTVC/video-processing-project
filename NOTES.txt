The tee project demonstrates the usage of the MultiIOBaseFilter base class but has only been tested in a limited fashion. (Using a webcam video/audio feed and teeing it into renderers.) It might NOT work for other media types etc.
Use this project solely to see how the MultiIOBaseFilter base class works.
Use the standard tee instead.

The RtspSourceFilter project uses the open source LGPL liveMedia library (available from www.live555.com) to 
handle the RTP/RTCP and RTSP communication.The live555 library has now been added to the source repository
in order to ensure version compatibility. The filter has been tested with an RTSP server (also available from 
www.live555.com) streaming 8/16 bit PCM, AMR and MP3, AAC, LATM audio, and H.264 video. This project demonstrates
 how DirectShow and RTP/RTCP and RTSP can be combined.
