TAG						: EGSVD

FILE NAME			: ExpGolombSignedVlcDecoder.h

DESCRIPTION		: An Exp-Golomb Vlc decoder implementation for signed 
								integer symbols as used in H.264 Recommendation (03/2005) 
								Table 9.3 page 196. This implementation is implemented 
								with an IVlcDecoder Interface and is an extention of the
								unsigned Exp-Golomb Vlc decoder.
