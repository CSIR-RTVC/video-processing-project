DESCRIPTION				: An interface to motion estimator implementations. Results
										are generated as a VectorList object.

REVISION HISTORY	: 29/09/2006 (KF) The reference to VectorList objects is
										depricated to allow any list object structure that is
										to be defined by the implementation.
