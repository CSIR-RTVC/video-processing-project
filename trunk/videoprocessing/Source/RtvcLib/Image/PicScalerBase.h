FILE NAME			: PicScalerBase.h

DESCRIPTION			: This class is the base class defining the minimum interface	
					and properties for all derived implementations to scale the
					dimensions of an image either up or down. The instantiation 
					process must set the parameters and limits to the images such 
					that the Scale()implementation only requires source image 
					data pointers. All memory new/delete must be handled outside 
					of these objects. The scale method is pure virtual and must be 
					implemented by derived classes.
