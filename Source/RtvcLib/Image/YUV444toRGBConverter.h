TAG						: YUVRGBC

FILE NAME			: YUV420toRGBConverter.h

DESCRIPTION		: Colour convertions are required on the output of
								all video codecs. For embedded applications only some
								combinations of colour depths and inversions are required.
								This class is the base class defining the minimum interface
								and properties for all derived classes.
